--SQL Self-sufficiency Exam (Final Exam)--

--For all of the following questions, you're working as a researcher for 
--your state's department of education, and using their database to create queries.

#1
--Write a query that selects column_name and data_type from 
--information_schema.columns.
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'naep';

#2
--Write a query to select the first fifty records of the naep table.
SELECT *
FROM naep
LIMIT 50;

#3
--Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. 
--Do this by using aliases, such as COUNT(avg_math_4_score) as count_4, 
--and repeat this for the remaining aliasesavg_4, min_4, and max_4, for AVG, MIN, and MAX, 
--respectively. Finally, sort the results alphabetically by state name.
SELECT	state,
		COUNT(avg_math_4_score) AS count_4,
		AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS avg_4,
		MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS min_4,
		MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS max_4	
FROM	naep
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state;

#4
--Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only 
--the summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state 
--with differences in max and min values that are greater than 30.
SELECT	state,
		COUNT(avg_math_4_score) AS count_4,
		AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS avg_4,
		MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS min_4,
		MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS max_4	
FROM	naep
GROUP BY state
HAVING MAX(avg_math_4_score) - MIN(avg_math_4_score) > 30
ORDER BY state;

#5
--Write a query that returns the avg_math_4_scoreas the alias avg_score 
--and the state as the alias bottom_10_states that lists the states in the bottom 10 
--for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.
SELECT	avg_math_4_score::float AS avg_score,
		state AS bottom_10_states
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score
LIMIT 10;

#6
--Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score 
--rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places over all states in the year 2000. 
--The resulting variable should still be named avg_math_4_score.
SELECT	ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score), 2) AS avg_math_4_score
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'

#7
--Write a query that returns a field called below_250 that lists all states 
--with an avg_math_4_score less than 250 over all states in the year 2000.
SELECT	state
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'
	AND avg_math_4_score < 250;
	
#8
--Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 
--that lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score 
--column of the naep data table for the year 2000.
SELECT state AS scores_missing_y2000
FROM naep
WHERE year = '2000'
	AND avg_math_4_score IS NULL;
